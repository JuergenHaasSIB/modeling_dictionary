# The ModelArchive modeling extension was moved to the repository of the Integrated and Hybrid Modeling (IHM) Working Group
see <a href="https://github.com/ihmwg/MA-dictionary">here</a> for details.

# Overview

## Goal

We are concerned with the long-term deposition of macromolecular models (currently modelarchive.org) and would like to overcome current limitations in the PDB format by using mmCIF. We propose an extension of the mmCIF (v5) format to incorporate data items and categories reflecting steps and decisions taken during a modeling process.
We are aiming at achieving transparency of the data deposited and ultimately envision reproducibility of the data deposited. A further goal is to enable iterative modeling/refinement processes starting from a given deposition achieving yet a better model representation than the one deposited.
